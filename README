Paralellized Implementation of a Neural Network

cmake files for MLP and CNN located in separate folders
Run the respective cmake file and generate executable for the output.

1. Multilayer Perceptron (MLP/)
    Top level source file - test.cpp

2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN/)
    Top level source file - test_cnn.cpp

The parameters for both the networks can be configured in the top level files.


Build/run instructions:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../MLP
or
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../CNN
$ make
$ ./APT_Project
